# Logger use in express(morgan or winston)
- professional debugging setup tools instaed of console.log
- a dedicated tool for recording info bout your application as it runs.In an Express app, its primary job is to create a structured, useful record of every incoming request and any errors that occur.

  # different format or modes of morgan
  It gives colored status codes for quick visual feedback.
  - app.use(morgan('dev')) The 'dev' format is great for development.
  - morgan('tiny')       // minimal
  - morgan('combined')   // detailed (good for production logs)
  - morgan('common')     // standard Apache log format

- In short, Morgan tells you what happened, and Winston gives you the power to record it properly, route it anywhere, and analyze it automatically.

- It's often better to crash the process so that an orchestrator (like PM2, Docker, or Kubernetes) can restart it, rather than letting it run in a broken state.
